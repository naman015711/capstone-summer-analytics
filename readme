Dynamic Pricing Engine for Urban Parking Lots

This project simulates a real-time intelligent pricing engine for 14 urban parking spaces using real-time data and demand-driven models.

The aim is to improve parking utilization by dynamically adjusting parking prices based on:
- Occupancy rate
- Queue length
- Traffic congestion
- Special events
- Vehicle type
